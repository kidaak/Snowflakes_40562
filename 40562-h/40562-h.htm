<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"Let's dance to the brown old earth to-night!"</div>
<div class="verse02">Cried one little flake of snow;</div>
<div class="verse00">"The autumn days have all passed by,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse00">I'm tired of my home here in the sky."</div>
<div class="verse02">So they all agreed to go.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">They dressed themselves in a misty film</div>
<div class="verse02">Of purest pearly white;</div>
<div class="verse00">Their feet were clad in velvet down,</div>
<div class="verse00">As soft and white as the filmy gown</div>
<div class="verse02">They wore to the dance that night.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Wrapped 'round with a drape of raveled gauze</div>
<div class="verse02">Were these little fays so fair.</div>
<div class="verse00">When out from a cloud a pale star beamed,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><div class="verse00">Bright diamonds sparkled, laughed, and gleamed</div>
<div class="verse02">In their fleecy, tangled hair.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">All ready, so pretty a crowd were they</div>
<div class="verse02">That naught could their charms enhance;</div>
<div class="verse00">Then softly and quickly they sped away,</div>
<div class="verse00">For the whisp'ring wind was the cab that they</div>
<div class="verse02">Rode in to the snowflakes' dance.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">They flew over housetop, hilltop, dell,</div>
<div class="verse02">With dances and with delight.</div>
<div class="verse00">Though ne'er did sound of their presence tell;</div>
<div class="verse00">Wherever their fairy footsteps fell,</div>
<div class="verse02">All turned to a crystal white.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">In the daintiest robes the trees were dressed,</div>
<div class="verse02">That ever you'd wish to see;</div>
<div class="verse00">The wayworn traveler, he was blessed,</div>
<div class="verse00">And stroked, and kissed, and soft-caressed,</div>
<div class="verse02">By these fays in rapturous glee.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Into every crevice and crack they peeped,</div>
<div class="verse02">They danced till the morning light;</div>
<div class="verse00">They left the print of their tiny feet</div>
<div class="verse00">O'er country road and city street,</div>
<div class="verse02">In frolicsome fun that night.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">When the rosy face of the morning sun</div>
<div class="verse02">Peeped timidly out to view,</div>
<div class="verse00">He beheld the earth, last night so brown,</div>
<div class="verse00">Arrayed in a snow-white velvet gown</div>
<div class="verse02">That sparkled like dancing dew.</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">'Tis sunrise o'er the eastern hills.</div>
<div class="verse02">All hail! thou lovely morn!</div>
<div class="verse00">Thy tender blush, thy mellow light</div>
<div class="verse02">Proclaim "The autumn's born."</div>
<div class="verse00">All nature is so wondrous fair,</div>
<div class="verse02">Bedecked with golden sheen&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse00">A fleecy cloudlet, here and there,</div>
<div class="verse02">In azure sky is seen.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">The gold and crimson leaves that give</div>
<div class="verse02">The trees their autumn gown,</div>
<div class="verse00">Are scattered by the gentle breeze</div>
<div class="verse02">Upon the meadows brown.</div>
<div class="verse00">Tho' summer flow'rs that were so fair</div>
<div class="verse02">Have faded, one by one,</div>
<div class="verse00">The goldenrod, in beauty rare,</div>
<div class="verse02">Her reign has just begun.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">The grapevines now are laden with</div>
<div class="verse02">Sweet clusters, oh, so blue!</div>
<div class="verse00">And scattered o'er the orchard ground</div>
<div class="verse02">Are rosy apples, too.</div>
<div class="verse00">Oh, who could sigh for summer skies,</div>
<div class="verse02">For summer flowers and trees,</div>
<div class="verse00">For singing birds and rainbow showers,</div>
<div class="verse02">'Mid autumn scenes like these?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">As sinks the glorious "King of Day"</div>
<div class="verse02">Adown the western sky,</div>
<div class="verse00">He bathes the trees and hilltops in</div>
<div class="verse02">A flood of crimson dye.</div>
<div class="verse00">He sets the westland all aglow</div>
<div class="verse02">Before he sinks away;</div>
<div class="verse00">So endeth, as a beauteous dream,</div>
<div class="verse02">This lovely autumn day.</div>

<div class="verse04">Thou'st driven away</div>
<div class="verse06">Old winter's dark hours.</div>
<div class="verse00">Poor fellow! he seemed rather loth to depart,</div>

<div class="verse10">Welcome, sweet May!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse04">Welcome, sweet May!</div>
<div class="verse06">That bringest to me,</div>
<div class="verse04">Wherever I stray,</div>
<div class="verse06">A sweet memory,</div>
<div class="verse00">When fragrant pink blossoms hung thick overhead,</div>
<div class="verse00">And love lay asleep in a violet bed.</div>
<div class="verse10">Welcome, sweet May!</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse04">Welcome, sweet May!</div>
<div class="verse06">With thy sunshine and showers,</div>
<div class="verse04">When young love awoke</div>
<div class="verse06">From sleep 'mong the flowers.</div>
<div class="verse00">Each year, in thy sunshine, 'neath heavens of blue,</div>
<div class="verse00">With thy sweet, fragrant blossoms he's wakened anew.</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">'Tis the dearest, coolest place I can find;</div>
<div class="verse00">There the locust and the wild grape entwined</div>
<div class="verse02">Float their dewy fragrance ever</div>
<div class="verse02">O'er the dancing St. Joe river</div>
<div class="verse00">On the wings of the soft drowsy wind.</div>

<div class="verse00">In the coziest of homes, neat and new,</div>

<div class="verse00">When a dwelling for his mate is in quest,</div>

<div class="verse02">In a drowse of rapture sweet</div>
<div class="verse02">Does this vale look up to meet,</div>
<div class="verse00">And to bask in the smile of the blue?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Would your soul free from troubles be made?</div>
<div class="verse00">All its worries and its burdens unlade?</div>
<div class="verse02">From the tumult and the heat</div>
<div class="verse02">Of the noisy city street,</div>

<div class="verse00">There you'll drink till you stagger as you plod,</div>
<div class="verse00">Of the sweets from the blossom-spangled sod,</div>
<div class="verse02">While your weary frame is drenched,</div>
<div class="verse02">And your thirsty soul is quenched,</div>

<div class="verse00">Sweet flower, what cold, unfeeling hand</div>
<div class="verse00">Hath plucked thee from that shady land</div>
<div class="verse02">Where clear, cool waters lie,</div>
<div class="verse00">And velvet mosses kissed thy feet?</div>
<div class="verse00">Who took thee from thy loved retreat,</div>
<div class="verse02">And left thee here to die?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Thou fairest gem of all the earth&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse00">E'en bonnie wilds that gave thee birth</div>
<div class="verse02">Thy petals' sweetness hold.</div>
<div class="verse00">I drink thy breath in fragrant draught,</div>
<div class="verse00">Sweeter than royal lips e'er quaffed</div>
<div class="verse02">From cups of burnished gold.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Who took thee from thy crystal home,</div>
<div class="verse00">Where finny tribes delight to roam</div>
<div class="verse02">And frisk in morning play;</div>
<div class="verse00">Where never harsher sound was heard</div>
<div class="verse00">Than fall of leaf or trill of bird,</div>
<div class="verse02">Or winds that softly sway</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">The trees that bend thy nook above,</div>
<div class="verse00">And, bending, whispered low of love</div>
<div class="verse02">To thee, my bonnie flower,</div>
<div class="verse00">Or whir of swallows' silken flight</div>
<div class="verse00">Across the waves, the calm delight</div>
<div class="verse02">Of evening's dappling shower?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Although thou'rt crushed beneath my feet,</div>
<div class="verse00">Thy dewy fragrance is more sweet</div>
<div class="verse02">Than at thy frail life's dawn.</div>
<div class="verse00">Thus, flow'r of love and purity,</div>
<div class="verse00">This lesson I have learned of thee:</div>
<div class="verse02">That when my friends are gone,</div>
<div class="verse00">And fate's rude tread has crushed my heart,</div>
<div class="verse00">Its blossoms shall more sweets impart</div>
<div class="verse02">Than at its first love's dawn.</div>

<div class="verse00">At rapid pace and fast increase</div>
<div class="verse02">It scuds across the sky!</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Arrayed in a garment of fleeciest down,</div>
<div class="verse00">The Winter-king rides over meadows so brown;</div>
<div class="verse00">Through wild wailing woodlands so stark and so bare,</div>
<div class="verse00">He rides on the wind to the great everywhere.</div>
<div class="verse00">He dresses the trees in the daintiest gown;</div>

<div class="verse00">With fairy-like fingers, unheard and unseen,</div>
<div class="verse00">He pictures, in crystal and silvery sheen,</div>

<div class="verse00">You hear the old pessimist counting his ills.</div>
<div class="verse00">With a sorrowful shake of the head murmurs he,</div>

<div class="verse00">Of ice, frost, and snow, on his jolly old back,</div>
<div class="verse00">And hies to the mountain, but leaves in his stead</div>
<div class="verse00">The Goddess of Love, with the blossom-crowned head;</div>
<div class="verse00">And a breath that is filled with the nectar and dew,</div>
<div class="verse00">She stole from the heart of the violet blue;</div>
<div class="verse00">A voice&mdash;O, the music that swells on the air</div>
<div class="verse00">From fresh-budding woodland, from hedge,&mdash;everywhere,</div>
<div class="verse00">Caressed by the sunlight and bathed by the showers,</div>
<div class="verse00">She walks on a carpet of mosses and flowers.</div>
<div class="verse00">Again comes the pessimist, grumpy and grim,</div>
<div class="verse00">And says the fair goddess has no charms for him.</div>
<div class="verse00">"'Tis raining too often, the corn and the wheat</div>
<div class="verse00">Will rot in the ground; there'll be nothing to eat;</div>
<div class="verse00">Besides, the old crow, in his greedy delight,</div>
<div class="verse00">Now raideth the cornfields from morning till night.</div>
<div class="verse00">A famine is certain! 'Tis sure to prevail!"</div>
<div class="verse00">And thus the old pessimist keeps up his wail.</div>

<div class="verse00">With silken folds falling and rising again,</div>
<div class="verse00">As scent-laden wind o'er their soft billows plays;</div>
<div class="verse00">Enraptured, she basks in the blue summer haze,</div>
<div class="verse00">Till bliss is dissolved into tear-laden showers,</div>
<div class="verse00">That drench all the trees and refresh all the flowers.</div>
<div class="verse00">As softly they fall on the roof o'er our heads,</div>
<div class="verse00">O, the sleep-haunted rapture their lullaby sheds!</div>
<div class="verse00">Though harvest with plenty his gran'ries hath filled,</div>
<div class="verse00">The murmuring pessimist never is stilled.</div>
<div class="verse00">He says, as he brushes the sweat from his brow,</div>

<div class="verse00">'Twill dry up the fruit, the grapes on the vine&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse00">Unless there's a change, they will yield us no wine."</div>
<div class="verse00">And thus the old pessimist grumbles away</div>

<div class="verse00">He maketh the lily of waxen-white hue,</div>

<div class="verse00">Yet lives there a king in such garments arrayed?</div>
<div class="verse00">Such beauty as robes this sweet flower of the glade?</div>

<div class="verse00">It looks up and trusts, and its needs are supplied.</div>

<h2><a id="CUPIDS_MISTAKE">CUPID'S MISTAKE.</a></h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Cupid looked forth one bright spring day,</div>
<div class="verse00">And whispered, "Now I must away.</div>
<div class="verse00">Old winter, with his frost and snow,</div>
<div class="verse00">Took his departure long ago.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"O'er roadside, field, and woodland, too,</div>
<div class="verse00">Sweet violets grow, with eyes so blue;</div>
<div class="verse00">Blossoms of every hue and shade</div>
<div class="verse00">The balmy air with perfume lade.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"There's light and sunshine everywhere;</div>
<div class="verse00">All nature is so wondrous fair;</div>
<div class="verse00">E'en from the woods the wild birds sing</div>
<div class="verse00">A welcome to the newborn spring.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"This surely is my harvest time,</div>
<div class="verse00">To make men bow at Love's sweet shrine;</div>
<div class="verse00">For all around, below, above,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<div class="verse00">Will help me make men fall in love."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">So from beneath his flow'ry tent</div>
<div class="verse00">He started on this mission bent.</div>
<div class="verse00">First to the halls of wealth and rank</div>
<div class="verse00">Went cunning Cupid with his prank.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">On reaching them, to his dismay,</div>
<div class="verse00">Those halls in deepest quiet lay;</div>
<div class="verse00">And music, once the food of love,</div>
<div class="verse00">Could not be heard below, above.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">So Cupid's little wings he spread,</div>
<div class="verse00">And, flying, to himself he said,</div>
<div class="verse00">"The lawyer will be in, I know,</div>
<div class="verse00">He's poring o'er his books, I trow.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"Poor fellow, what a lot is his!</div>
<div class="verse00">To be shut up a day like this,</div>
<div class="verse00">From sunlight, flowers, and wild bird's song,</div>
<div class="verse00">Trying to balance right and wrong.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"I'll take my tiny little dart,</div>
<div class="verse00">And lightly touch the lawyer's heart,</div>
<div class="verse00">And show him how love's sweet, glad light</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
<div class="verse00">Can make his dingy office bright."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">But when he reached the longed-for spot,</div>
<div class="verse00">He found the studious lawyer not.</div>
<div class="verse00">These words he read upon the door,</div>
<div class="verse00">"The lawyer will be in at four."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"To the office of the doctor kind</div>
<div class="verse00">I'll go," said he, "for there I'll find</div>
<div class="verse00">Him tending to his patients' ills</div>
<div class="verse00">With soothing balms and dainty pills."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">But doctor's doors were closed, and lo!</div>
<div class="verse00">Just as poor Cupid turned to go,</div>
<div class="verse00">These words he read 'twixt tears, alack!</div>
<div class="verse00">"At six the doctor will be back."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Next to the dentist man he flew,</div>
<div class="verse00">And called upon the merchant, too;</div>
<div class="verse00">In every place, the city 'round,</div>
<div class="verse00">But not a bit of game he found.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"Well, well!" said Cupid, with a moan,</div>
<div class="verse00">"The world has cold and heartless grown."</div>
<div class="verse00">So once again his wings he spread,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
<div class="verse00">And over country roads he sped,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Back toward his home among spring flowers,</div>
<div class="verse00">And shady walks, and leafy bowers;</div>
<div class="verse00">But as he flew the stream beside,</div>
<div class="verse00">A crowd of wheelmen there he spied.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"Ha! ha!" laughed he, "I've found them all,</div>
<div class="verse00">Both short and tall, both great and small.</div>
<div class="verse00">Oh, what a pretty lad I see</div>
<div class="verse00">Gliding along so merrily!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"With pretty boots laced to the knee,</div>
<div class="verse00">His limbs how shapely, blithe, and free;</div>
<div class="verse00">If I can get such game as he,</div>
<div class="verse00">This trip a grand success will be."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">So, saying this, his bow he bent,</div>
<div class="verse00">And through the air his arrow sent;</div>
<div class="verse00">Straight toward this pretty lad it flew,</div>
<div class="verse00">And pierced his bosom through and through.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"My! wasn't that a blissful aim.</div>
<div class="verse00">I'll fly to earth and get my game."</div>
<div class="verse00">But when he reached that laddie's side</div>
<div class="verse00">He looked perplexed, then horrified.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">Then quickly rose and flew away,</div>
<div class="verse00">And as he went was heard to say:</div>
<div class="verse00">"Oh, what a blunder! Now I see</div>
<div class="verse00">Fort Wayne is not the place for me;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse00">"For, counting now my time and cost,</div>
<div class="verse00">This lovely day is worse than lost.</div>
<div class="verse00">My wings are weary, brain's awhirl,</div>
<div class="verse00">For, oh, 'twas but a Bloomer Girl!"</div>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
